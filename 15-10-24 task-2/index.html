        <p>Nature’s archive comprises all the content published since the journal’s launch in 1869;  it includes some images, articles and language that by twenty-first-century standards are offensive and harmful, including sexist, racist and other discriminatory content. This content does not represent Nature’s current values and would be unacceptable to publish today. We have not sought to suppress it because it is part of the scientific and historical record, and so should remain available for scholars now and in the future. Nature is committed to making the changes necessary to ensure that it learns from its past and creates a publication that champions science for everyone.n Greek mythology, Persephone, daughter of Demeter (goddess of the harvest), was abducted by Hades (god of the dead), and taken to the underworld as his queen.
